BLE CUBE


1 - BLE
1.1 - Advertising
1.1.1 - Advertising packet structure

The device advertises a well defines packet as defined here below:

FIRST_LENGTH_POS: first length
ADV_TYPE_FLAGS_POS: adv flags type
BR_EDR_NOT_SUPPORTED_POS: BR/EDR not supported
SECOND_LENGTH_POS: second length
MANUF_DATA_TYPE_POS: manufacturer data type
MANUF_ID_BYTE_0_POS: manufacturer ID lower byte
MANUF_ID_BYTE_1_POS: manufacturer ID higher byte
MANUF_DATA_LENGTH_POS: data length
SERVICE_ID_BYTE_0_POS: service ID lower byte
SERVICE_ID_BYTE_1_POS: service ID higher byte
DATA_BYTE_0_POS: data byte 0
DATA_BYTE_1_POS: data byte 1
DATA_BYTE_2_POS: data byte 2 
DATA_BYTE_3_POS: data byte 3 
DATA_BYTE_4_POS: data byte 4 
DATA_BYTE_5_POS: data byte 5 
DATA_BYTE_6_POS: data byte 6 
DATA_BYTE_7_POS: data byte 7 
CALIB_RSSI_POS: calibrated RSSI 

with the defined values:

0x02: first length 
ADV_FLAGS_TYPE: adv flags type 
BR_EDR_NOT_SUPPORTED: BR/EDR not supported 
(uint8_t)(MANUF_DATA_LENGTH + 4): second length 
MANUF_DATA_TYPE: manufacturer data type 
(uint8_t)MANUFACTURER_ID: manufacturer ID lower byte 
(uint8_t)(MANUFACTURER_ID >> 8): manufacturer ID higher byte 
MANUF_DATA_LENGTH: manufacturer data length 
(uint8_t)MANUF_SERVICE_ID: service ID lower byte 
(uint8_t)(MANUF_SERVICE_ID >> 8): service ID higher byte 
INITIAL_FACE_INDEX_VALUE: Data 0 
0x00: Data 1 
0x00: Data 2 
0x15: Data 3 
0x00: Data 4 
0x00: Data 5 
0x00: Data 6 
0x00: Data 7 
TX_POWER_MEASURED_RSSI: RSSI TX power

The MANUFACTURER_ID is attributed at each company from Bluetooth SIG and in this case it is flash memory defined.
The SERVICE_ID is also flash memory defined and it is a custom field indicating a specific service implemented by the device. 
This field is used by other compatible products to understand the behaviour of the device.
The following 8 bytes are specific to the service ID and represent the shared data between devices that support that service.
The CALIB_RSSI field is a calibrated value of RSSI in two's complement. It is not used by a scanner device at the moment (TO BE DEFINED). 

1.1.2 - Advertised service data
Advertised data from a remote controller are 8 byte long.
The defined service ID is the only supported and related data bytes are managed as below:

DATA_BYTE_0_POS: cube face which the cube leans on
DATA_BYTE_1_POS: not used 
DATA_BYTE_2_POS: any value change means that new light values follow 
DATA_BYTE_3_POS: new RED value in % (0 - 100) 
DATA_BYTE_4_POS: new GREEN value in % (0 - 100) 
DATA_BYTE_5_POS: new BLUE value in % (0 - 100) 
DATA_BYTE_6_POS: new WHITE value in % (0 - 100) 
DATA_BYTE_7_POS: not used 

The new light values are update when the cube confirms to be lean on a new face prior movement detection (TO BE IMPLEMENTED SINCE IT UPDATES THE CURRENT POSITION PERIODICALLY AT THE MOMENT).


1.2 - Services

There is only one service available which contains the following characteristics:
- PRESET1
- PRESET2
- SPECIAL_OP
The base UUID of the service is: {{0x8A, 0xAF, 0xA6, 0xC2, 0x3A, 0x32, 0x8F, 0x84, 0x75, 0x4F, 0xF3, 0x02, 0x01, 0x50, 0x65, 0x20}}
and the three characteristics PRESET1, PRESET2 and SPECIAL_OP have an UUID increment of respectively 0x05, 0x0A and 0x0F. 

1.2.1 - PRESET1 and PRSET2 characteristics
There characteristics are 15 byte long with read and write access. Each characteristic is divided in 3 groups of 5 values. 
The first 4 are RGBW PWM values in pecentage from 0 to 100 while the fifth one is not used at the moment. 
Each group of 5 represent configuration data for the related face index. PRESET1 contains data for face 1, 2 and 3 while PRESET2 for 4, 5 and 6. 
The lower the group is in the characteristic, the lower is the related index: first 5 values of PRESET1 contained between byte 0 and byte 4 are related to face 1 and so on. 
These characteristics are stored in persistent memory. Application.c module defines default values:

100: Preset 1 - R			
0: Preset 1 - G
0: Preset 1 - B 
0: Preset 1 - W 
0xFF: Preset 1 - Unused 
0: Preset 2 - R 					
100: Preset 2 - G 	
0: Preset 2 - B 
0: Preset 2 - W 
0xFF: Preset 2 - Unused 
0: Preset 3 - R 						
0: Preset 3 - G 
100: Preset 3 - B 
0: Preset 3 - W 
0xFF: Preset 3 - Unused 
68: Preset 4 - R 						
100: Preset 4 - G 
0: Preset 4 - B 
0: Preset 4 - W 
0xFF: Preset 4 - Unused 
0: Preset 5 - R 						
90: Preset 5 - G 
100: Preset 5 - B 
0: Preset 5 - W 
0xFF: Preset 5 - Unused 
49: Preset 6 - R 							
100: Preset 6 - G 
55: Preset 6 - B 
0: Preset 6 - W 
0xFF: Preset 6 - Unused 

1.2.2 - SPECIAL OP characteristic
This characteristic is 1 byte long and can be written only. Upon write command the new value is sent to application module and managed accordingly. 
Any special command can be implemented. The only valid command implemented at the moment is:

DFU_UPGRADE_CHAR_PASSWORD: 0xA9

used for entering in bootloader mode to perform a firmware upgrade.
